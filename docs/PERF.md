# Performance

There are two parts to `coq.nvim`'s performance:

Human computer interactions (HCI) and raw execution speed.

The design of `coq.nvim` puts a lot of thought into both. In particular, **raw execution speed enables HCI optimizations**.

---

## HCI

**Humans are much slower than computers**, therefore when we think about performance, we not only need to think about the cost to compute.

Below a certain threshold, **the cost to humans**, ie. reading and decision time will dominate most HCI scenarios.

### Ranking

**humans read slow**

`coq.nvim` uses a two stage approach for `filtering` and `sorting`.

- filtering: fast and robust to typos

- sorting: comprehensive

In particular, the stages borrows ideas from data science, to process and normalize inputs and weights.

### Fuzziness

**humns typo bad**

Both stages of `coq.nvim` use algorithms resilient to typical errors of `transposition`, `insertion`, `deletion` and `substitution`.

### Informativeness

**humans have low working memory**

`coq.nvim` is designed to provide as much information to users as possible.

ie.

- paths source will preview file content, or directory listings.

- treesitter source will show two levels of lexical context

- ctags source will show lexical context, line number, file name, etc

... et al.

## Raw execution speed

### Throughput vs latency

**Perceived performance** has much more to do with responsiveness rather than overall time elapsed.

At every level of `coq.nvim`, the design is to explicitly trade better throughput for better latency.

This is the same design decision behind many "fast" garbage collectors.

In broad strokes, this means making `coq.nvim` **concurrent**, which introduces costs to throughput, but enables **other optimizations** detailed below.

### Randomization

`coq.nvim` actually performs randomization of data ingestion order.

This is to ensure fairness in scenarios in which `coq.nvim` is unable to chew through the incoming text /events.

### SQLite

`coq.nvim` spins up over half a dozen independent SQLite VMs.

Not only are `sqlite3` VMs fast af due to `C`, and `btrees`, and countless hours of optimizations.

They also provide **even further speed ups**, these will be elaborated further in later parts of this document.

### Parallelism

There is this persistent myth that _cpython programs_ cannot take advantage of threading for non-io tasks.

In fact, _cpython code_ cannot run in parallel due to the [`GIL`](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/init.html), but _c code_ can!

Assuming that they use the `Py_BEGIN_ALLOW_THREADS`, `Py_END_ALLOW_THREADS` macro, which releases the `GIL`.

**`sqlite3`** is one of those special stdlibs using these two macros, hence it is exploited to provide compute.

### Concurrency

`coq.nvim` takes advantage of concurrency via two main avenues:

1. Threading, for io and sqlite3

2. Coroutines, wherever possible

#### Threading

Interestingly, `coq.nvim` actually **performs better**, when cpython is tuned to **switch threads more often**.

This is the opposite of many toy parallelism examples, whereby adding threads to a numerical problem slows down computation.

That is because `coq.nvim` is not just performing numerical compute.

When mixing io and compute, cpython introduces a deliberate and significant overhead to GIL acquisition.

Through GIL tuning, `coq.nvim` is able to mostly ignore this cost, but man, none of this is at all obvious.

#### Coroutines

Coroutines are used ubiquitously in `coq.nvim`. Unlike pthreads, coroutines are scheduled collaboratively instead of preemptively.

In other words, instead of the runtime (ie. cpython, OS), `coq.nvim` **performs its own task scheduling**.

What it means is that `coq.nvim` has total control over both **when and _if_** tasks are scheduled.

Notably, **`sqlite3` VMs can be manually preempted**, and therefore we can schedule them like coroutines.

### Task scheduling

`coq.nvim` probably has the most **advanced task scheduler** out of any completion engine, not just for vim.

#### Do nothing

By definition, the **fastest thing to do is to do nothing**.

Half the battle is figuring out what tasks can be optimizated away to nil.

##### Flow control

In a naive network with limited capacity, if the rate of ingress exceeds the capacity of egress, the network will eventually enter a doom spiral, where the incoming traffic piling up in congestion. This phenomenon is referred to as [bufferbloat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bufferbloat)

For `coq.nvim`, this issue is solved akin to how the linux packet queue [`tc-cake`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/tc-cake.8.html) works on a basic level for TCP traffic sharping.

Dropping from the front of the queue: That's it!

Since TCP already ensures packet ordering on a protocol level, this is totally safe to do!

Likewise, for `coq.nvim`, user events that have guaranteed ordering are basically treated the same way.

##### Cancel culture

If something is outdated, we cancel it.

_Manual preemption_ of not just coroutines but also `sqlite3`, takes place on each keystroke.

In fact, in `coq.nvim`: before any new tasks can be scheduled, all previous tasks must be interrupted.

#### Background Processing

There is a certain down time between after completion results are shown to users, and the next keystroke.

`coq.nvim` takes advantage of this by processing additional rows of data into the `sqlite3` cache.

Naturally, these background tasks are also interruptible.

#### Deadline optimization

`coq.nvim` can as fast as possible, but the `LSP` servers can still take forever to respond.

Normally, this is handled by a deadline, where If the `LSP` servers do not respond in time, other completion sources will be shown after a timeout.

A secret optimization is put into place such that if no results are shown yet, `coq.nvim` will keep on waiting on the slower sources.

### Source local optimizations

##### LSP

- sqlite3 caching

##### Treesitter

- partial document parsing

- buf local disable if parsing takes longer than 10 frames

##### Ctags

- sqlite3 db instead of binary search into a large tags file

##### TabNine

- flood prevention
